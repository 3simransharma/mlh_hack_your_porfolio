## Introduction:

"Yammi" is an AI/ML-powered web-based project created for the hackathon "MLH Hack Your Portfolio." This platform addresses the challenge of selecting the perfect substitute ingredients for various dishes without any hassle.
Stack Used:


## Challenge and Problem:

Finding suitable substitute ingredients for specific dishes can be a hassle, often requiring extensive research or culinary expertise. This problem is especially prominent for home cooks who may need quick alternatives due to dietary restrictions or the unavailability of certain ingredients.

## Stack used

This project is built with NextJS and TensorFlow library.

## Model used
The project uses tensorFlow library which has a neural network algorithm with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function, consisting of dense layers with ReLU and softmax activations.

the website leverages advanced machine learning to provide accurate and relevant ingredient substitutions. The design of the site is inspired by the Kawaii style, ensuring a visually appealing and delightful user interface. Additionally, my UI/UX and illustration skills have been implemented to provide a seamless and enjoyable user experience, making it easier for users to navigate and find the information they need.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
